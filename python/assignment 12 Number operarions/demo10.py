Lift Mode Operation – Advanced Smart Elevator System


A smart building elevator works in multiple intelligent modes based on the mode number entered by the control panel.  

The system must automatically execute floor movement instructions using loops.


Write a program:


- If mode = 1  

  Normal Up Mode activated.  

  Read current floor and destination floor.  

  Print all floors from current to destination in ascending order.


- Else if mode = 2  

  Down Mode activated.  

  Read current floor and destination floor.  

  Print all floors from current to destination in descending order.


- Else if mode = 3  

  Energy Saving Mode activated.  

  Read destination floor.  

  Lift starts from ground floor (0) and stops only on alternate floors till destination.


- Else  

  Emergency Mode activated.  

  Print "Emergency Alarm" 4 times using loop.
